    <h2>About my journey of yoga </h2>

    <p>
      My yoga journey has evolved significantly over the last few years & I find that the more I delve the more there is to learn.
    </p> 
    
    <p>
      Yoga is a journey to our inner world and to the core & essence of our being. I have never asked these questions more in my life. ‘Who am I? What is the purpose of life?’
    </p>

    <p>
      I continue to inquire these questions again & again through my daily practice & teaching. I have also never been as happy as I am now. Happy not because of any material or mental conditioning, but because I have found my passion & love of yoga and because I’m able to ask questions about life with inquisitiveness & enthusiasm again & again and not drawing conclusions. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As a practice of moving meditation, yoga can be an amazing tool to develop compassionate discipline, awareness & higher consciousness through conscious breathing.The practice of conscious breathing and moving our bodies with mindfulness is to unite all parts of our body, mind and spirit in order to live our lives with more awakened energy, balance & inner peace.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal as a teacher is to share my experience of yoga with creativity, compassion and love for the benefit of others and world at large.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m very grateful to have met and been inspired by the many teachers I have trained with in England, South Korea and in the U.S. Some of my biggest influences have been Richard Freeman, Mary Taylor, Kino MacGregor, Tim Feldmann & Sharath Jois.
